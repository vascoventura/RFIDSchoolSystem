# RFIDSchoolSystem

- Software Engineer Degree Capstone Project. 

- Using PHP, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL Database, I implemented a RFID system turned to teachers and students. First, itÂ´s important to know that teachers needs are different than student needs. They represent different objects.

- On this system, each student will be able to mark his/her preseance every class he/she goes.

- One class will only occur if the teacher is present in the right class, in the right schedule.

- This means that, first of all, the system has to know each Cards ID, connected to each user (Teachers and Students).


-- Each user will have access to an account on a developed website insert in the same project that is hosted in https://ipgcarde.000webhostapp.com/projetoFinal.php.
